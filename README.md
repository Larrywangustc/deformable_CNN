# deformable_CNN
The defomable CNN for TensorFlow 2.x version.

The deformable CNN source code is written by TensorFlow 1.x version. And I have edited layer.py such that it is compatible with tensorflow 2.x.

My environment version is python 3.9 and tensorflow 2.9.1

There is also a demo for deformable CNN, which uses MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database).
